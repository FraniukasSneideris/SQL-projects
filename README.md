Analyzing a Japanese University Students' Mental Health
# Impact of Length of Stay on Mental Health â€“ SQL Data Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project explores the mental health impact of studying abroad by analyzing survey data from a Japanese international university. The survey, conducted in 2018, assessed international students' mental health through various diagnostic tests. The aim was to determine if the length of stay in a foreign country influences the likelihood of depression, acculturative stress, and social connectedness.  

## Objective  
The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between students' length of stay and their average mental health scores. The analysis is conducted using PostgreSQL to derive insights that might reflect trends found in the original study, which concluded that international students are at a higher risk for mental health issues compared to the general population.  

## Key Tasks  
- Query and manipulate the students' survey data using SQL.  
- Calculate the average mental health scores across three diagnostic tests:  
  - **PHQ-9 Test** (depression)  
  - **SCS Test** (social connectedness)  
  - **ASISS Test** (acculturative stress)  
- Analyze how these scores vary based on the students' length of stay.  
- Summarize findings in a table, showing:  
  - **Length of stay** (stay)  
  - **Count of international students** (count_int)  
  - **Average PHQ score** (average_phq)  
  - **Average SCS score** (average_scs)  
  - **Average ASISS score** (average_as)  

## Results  
The final output is a table with nine rows and five columns, sorted by the length of stay in descending order.  
- The data highlights trends in mental health among international students based on their duration in the host country.  

## Technologies Used  
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL)  
- **DataCamp** (for project environment and data)  

## Key Skills Demonstrated  
- Aggregating and manipulating data using SQL.  
- Performing calculations with aggregate functions.  
- Using aliases for readability and clarity.  
- Rounding results to two decimal places for precision.  
- Sorting and structuring data to derive meaningful insights.  

## How to Use  
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Review the SQL scripts for insights into the analysis process.  
3. Use the queries as templates for similar analytical projects involving survey or mental health data.  

## About  
This project is part of my ongoing transition into data analysis, demonstrating my ability to apply SQL in real-world scenarios. The analysis reflects my growing skills in data exploration, querying, and deriving actionable insights from datasets.
